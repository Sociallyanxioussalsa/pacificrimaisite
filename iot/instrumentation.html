    <h1>Deep Instrumentation and Data Analytics</h1>
    <section class="description">
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Embedding multi-modal sensors in systems allows deep instrumentation of industrial and biological systems 
        to capture fine-grained, real-time data across multiple spatial and temporal scales.
        Such sensor fusion then enables valuable descriptive and predictive analytics, and advanced AI applications.
        <br><br>
        Such instrumentation may be useful at different spatial or temporal scales.
        Micro-scale sensing may include in-body biosensors, wearables, or embedded MEMS for capturing localized 
        physiological or material changes (e.g., glucose, vibration, pH, EMG). Similarly meso- or macro-scale sensors
        allow environmental, infrastructural or population-level monitoring.
        Similarly, on the time scale, sensing could be igh-Frequency, real-time telemetry (ECGs, accelerometers, vibration)
        or low-frequency/longitudinal sensing such as periodic glucose levels, weekly movement patterns, etc.
        <br><br>
        Despite differences in these scales, common engineering aspects apply to such systems. We focus here on 
        two projects demonstrating the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Sensor fusion: 
            <ul>
              <li>Heterogeneous sensor integration across modalities to enhance context awareness</li>
              <li>Time sync and accurate timestamping for cross-correlation</li>
              <li>Data Normalization & Calibration</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Data Logging and Storage: 
            <ul>
              <li>Edge-to-Cloud Pipelines to aggregate raw or preprocessed data for higher-order analysis.</li>
              <li>Buffering and on-device storage to handle intermittent connectivity</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Advanced Analytics and AI: 
            <ul>
              <li>Time-series analysis and forecasting, e.g. predictig patient deterioration, maintenance needs, or energy consumption</li>
              <li>Anomaly Detection for outliers in behavior, environment, or performance</li>
              <li>Closed-loop control e.g. insulin pumps, climate control, autonomous navigation</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        The two projects highlighted below demonstrate successful implementation of these engineering principles with real, functioning prototypes.

      <h2>Integrated device for multi-scale instrumentation</h2>
      <p>
        Sensing at multiple temporal and spatial scales often need to be combined into integrated, connected systems. Take for example
        an integrated system for storage and transportation of environment-controlled, perishable materials like vaccines. We may 
        need to measure temperature and humidity at "lab/room scale", weather conditions at "city scale" to plan logistics and transport,
        and at "planet scale" (inclement weather, hurricanes, etc) that may dirupt the global supply chain.
        <br>
        Lab-scale data is best gathered with sensors, city-scale data is available through public APIs such as the 
        OpenWeatherMap API, whereas planet-scale data is available from NASA's EONET (Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker) 
        system through NASA's open APIs. This is a good analogy for building systems that fuse data across sensors, 
        medical systems, ERP systems, and so on. 
        <br>
        This integrated system was architected as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>The base platform to integrate everything is the <b>Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266</b>, a microcontroller board 
            that has rich connectivity functionality - not just for
            short-range / bluetooth but also WiFi so that we can access public APIs. </li>
          <li>Using the <b>Adafruit 2.4" TFT FeatherWing</b> we a TFT display</li>
          <li>Our lab-scale sensors include the <b>DHT-22</b> for temperature and humidity, and an <b>LDR</b> (Light-dependent resistor)</li>​
          <li>Our city-scale sensing comes from the <b>OpenWeatherMap API</b></li>
          <li>Our planet-scale sensing comes from the <b>NASA EONET Open API</b></li>
          <li>Finally, using the Arduino IDE, its rich suite of libraries, and opensource code we are able to integrate sensor data at all scales</li>
         </ul>
         The final system setup looks like this. The video below shows a live demonstration of the system.

      <h2>Photosynthetic activity comparitive analysis</h2>
      <p>
        This project involves measuring the impact of multiple variables on photosynthesis.
        A terrarium is a closed glass enclosure containing soil, fertilizer and water that allows plants to grow 
        in a measurable, controlled environment. 
        Each terrarium is subject to different environmental conditions and the impact on plant growth was measured.
        A single integrated platform was built for each terrarium, comprising sensors for light intensity, temperature and humidity, 
        and a data logger for timeseries data storage and analysis.
        <br>
        This integrated system was architected as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>To build the smallest possible form-factor, the <b>Arduino Nano</b> microcontroller was used</li>
          <li>A <b>TSL 2561 Lux sensor</b> was used to measure light intensity variation.​</li>
          <li>The <b>DHT-11</b> sensor was used for integrated temperature and humidity.</li>
          <li>An <b>SD card module</b> was used to log timeseries data in a simple, "flat" file system.</li>
          <li>A portable power source was created using a DIY 4XAA battery case</li>
          <li>Using the Arduino IDE, a data gathering loop was implemented for all sensors on syncronized time.</li>
         </ul>
         The final system setup and measurements are shown below. After running the experiment for several weeks, the 
         plant with the higher values of light intensity showed greater growth as expected.
