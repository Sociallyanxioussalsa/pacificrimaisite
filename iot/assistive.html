    <h1>Assistive Devices</h1>
    <section class="description">
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Assistive Internet of Things (IoT) devices span a broad spectrum—from "macro-scale" - enhancing daily living for people 
        with disabilities or the elderly - to "micro-scale" wearables and implantables for health monitoring.
        <br><br>
        Despite differences in scale and functionality, these devices share several common engineering aspects, that are 
        crucial for their effectiveness, safety, and adoption. Given the obvious constraints in experimenting with complex 
        micro-scale devices, we focus here on two macro-scale device projects, highlighting common engineering elements of:
        <ul>
          <li>Connectivity & Interoperability: 
            <ul>
              <li>Use of wireless communication (eg. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, or cellular) to sync data with smartphones, cloud platforms, or caregivers.</li>
              <li>Use of standard protocols</li>
              <li>Low-latency, reliabile implementation for time-sensitive use cases</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Data Management: 
            <ul>
              <li>Sensing & Signal Processing for accurate data acquisition (e.g., motion, vitals, environment)</li>
              <li>Analytics, storage, and logging for AI/ML applications</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Power Management: 
            <ul>
              <li>Low Power Consumption, especially vital for implantables and wearables</li>
              <li>Optionality in energy storage</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Update & Maintenance: 
            <ul>
              <li>Firmware Over-the-Air (FOTA) for remote updates or patching security vulnerabilities
              <li>Self-diagnostics and logging for troubleshooting and performance.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        The two projects highlighted below demonstrate successful implementation of these engineering principles with real, functioning prototypes.

      <h2>I-Care Assistive wearable band</h2>
      <p>
        <i>Active ageing</i> is the process of optimizing opportunities for health, participation and security in order to 
        enhance quality of life as people age, often using wearable technology. <br>
        This project created a smart wearable band
        using the <b>Adafruit FLORA</b> platform, using <b>conductive wiring</b> for stitching, small form factor sensors such
        as the <b>TSL 2561 light intensity sensor</b> and actuators such as <b>"neoPixel" LEDs</b>. The key scenario shown in 
        figures below is low-light detection and warning, though the platform was tested to extend successfully 
        to use cases with sensors such as GPS and heart rate sensors.
        <br>
        The prototype require no setup from the user, ideal for non-tech savvy seniors.
        <br>
        The following figure illustrates the process, circuitry and design of key components of the system.

      <h2>Assistive Cane</h2>
      <p>
        This project was done at NCSU as part of the course E101, that challenged us to create an affordable assistive device.
        <br>
        The system uses multiple, strategically placed distance sensors to sense obstructions
        and actuate a device (sound alarm, vibrator or motor) to indicate a hazard for the visually impaired.
        <br>
        The system was built on the <b>UNO R3</b> microcontroller board.
        <br>
        A fellow student who is legally blind helped inform the design and verify the utility of the device.
        <br>
        A key non-technical constraint was for the cost of materials and production to be less than $60, which informed
        key design decisions on selecting the bill of materials and sensors. For example, we could not use an expensive 360-degree sensor and 
        intead used multiple low-cost ultrasonic / infrared sensors to provide scene coverage.
