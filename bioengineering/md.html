    <h1>Modeling protein complex and drug carrier stability with Molecular Dynamics</h1>
    <section class="description">
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Once favorable docking behavior of a protein-drug complex is established - for example, successful binding of lecanemab 
        to Alzheimer's amyloid-β plaques, making it ready for removal by microglia - we need to establish that the complex is stable
        in the physiological (in-vivo) environment where it is supposed to act. 
        <br><br>
        Additionally, biomolecules for drug delivery (eg. liposomes, dendrimers, micelles, or protein-based nanocarriers) should 
        have specific behavior to assess suitability - for triggered delivery, slow-release or targeted delivery, 
        pH-responsive delivery (e.g., tumor or endosome targeting) or potential for cellular uptake through membranes.

      <h2>Simulating in-vivo behavior in-silico</h2>
      <p>
        Predicting and evaluating the behavior of drug-protein complexes and drug-carrier biomolecules
        <i>before</i> moving to more resource-intensive in-vitro or in-vivo studies offers a powerful and cost-effective means
        to reduce failure rates, accelerate discovery, and promote more targeted and efficient pharmaceutical development.
        <br><br>
        Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations provide atomic-level resolution on binding modes, conformational changes, 
        hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and allosteric effects that are difficult to capture experimentally.
        They can also eliminate unstable or non-specific binding, to eliminate weak candidates early in the development process.
        <br><br>
        For drug delivery systems, they can evaluate encapsulation efficiency, release profiles, stability of drug-carrier interactions, 
        and interaction with biological membranes.
        <br><br>
        MD is also highly scalable because a variety of physiological / in-vivo conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, ion concentration) 
        can be used to mimic realistic environments.

      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        In this study, the behavior of Factor Xa - a protein playing a critical role in the formation of blood clots - is simulated 
        in a simple aqueous system. Stability is then analyzed using RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation)
        from the reference structure and Rg (Radius of Gyration) for compactness. The steps are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li><b>GROMACS</b> was used as the MD system. </li>
          <li>The crystal structure of Factor Xa is available as <b>1FJS</b> in the PDB. /li>
          <li>A simulation "box" (3D cell) is created and filled with water and ions to neutralize the system.</li>
          <li>Energy Minimization (EM) is run to relax the system to remove steric clashes.</li>
          <li>The system is equilibrated to stabilize temperature at constant volume, and stabilize pressure and density at constant temperature and pressure.</li>
          <li>A production run performs the actual MD simulation to generate trajectories. </li>
          <li>Finally the system is visualized using tools for RMSD, Rg and energy plots.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
